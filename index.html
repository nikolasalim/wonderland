        Hey Wonderland team, thanks for checking in! <br /><br />I'm Niko – and
        that's my head over there, bouncing like a dvd logo. I hope it's not too
        distracting (I know it is). <br />
        Here are my answers: <br /><br />
      </span>

      <span id="h1">How do people describe you?</span>
      <br />
      <span id="h2"
        >Hard-working and creative. And sometimes weird. Luckly, I take weird as
        a compliment.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span id="h1"
        >A situation when you took a risk to achieve a goal. What was the
        outcome and what did you learn?
      </span>
      <br />
      <span id="h2"
        >When I first got to Amsterdam, I needed to find a job to keep me
        moving. I wanted to try something completely different from what I've
        been doing at that time (creative copywriting). I like to cook. I like
        sushi. I had no familiarity with incredibly sharp knives. Still, I got
        the job as a sushi apprentice at FoodHallen's Meneer Temaki. I ended up
        learning way less about sharp knives, and way more about working under
        pressure, keeping my stuff organized, and working as a team.<br />
        Plus: now I can make some decent sushi.

      <br />
      <span id="h1">Describe your dream job.</span>
      <br />
      <span id="h2"
        >One that would give me the opportunity to learn with my fellow
        colleagues, but would also give me freedom to experiment and try things
        on my own.</span
      >
      <br />
      <br />
      <span id="h1">What is your ultimate day-off agenda?</span>
      <br />
      <span id="h2"
        >Wake up to pancakes. Improvise the rest. I like to keep my days-off
        completely agendaless.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span id="h1">What’s your favourite thing about Amsterdam?</span>
      <br />
      <span id="h2"
        >Amsterdam is the biggest smallest city I've ever been to. There's
        always so much of everything going on, but at the same time it's so easy
        to find peace and quiet.</span
      >
      <br />
      <br />
      <span id="h1">Who inspires you and why?</span>
      <br />
      <span id="h2">
        <a href="https://mschf.xyz/" target="_blank">Id'say MSCHF.</a> It's not
        a "who", but it's been one of my go-to bookmarks lately. I guess because
        it's fresh, off-beat, and they don't take themselves too
        seriously.</span
